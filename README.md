# Library Database Front End
This was the final project in my Netcentric Computing course, CSC 3221. April 2021 - June 2021.

We were tasked with using HTML, potentially CSS, and JavaScript to create a mock library API on a node.js runtime environment. The API uses Mongoose to interact with a MongoDB database, and supports various functions such as adding books or authors, searching for a book or an author - whether by title or id, and modifying a book or an author.

This was the largest scale web API that I had built, and it taught me a great deal about how to interact with a database from the back end, and translate those interactions to the front end to display the database information for the view to see. For future development, I plan on adding further functionality to the database interactions, and exploring the different functionalities of node and Mongoose.

*Note: The back end repository of this web application is kept private for security concerns regarding the connection to the MongoDB database. However, in the folder entitled "back-end", I have included the code for each of the routers used when creating the back end.*

Here are a few pictures of what the website looks like:
