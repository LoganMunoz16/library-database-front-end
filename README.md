# Library Database Front End
This was the final project in my Netcentric Computing course, CSC 3221. April 2021 - June 2021.

We were tasked with using HTML, potentially CSS, and JavaScript to create a mock library API on a node.js runtime environment. The API uses Mongoose to interact with a MongoDB database, and supports various functions such as adding books or authors, searching for a book or an author - whether by title or id, and modifying a book or an author.

This was the largest scale web API that I had built, and it taught me a great deal about how to interact with a database from the back end, and translate those interactions to the front end to display the database information for the view to see. For future development, I plan on adding further functionality to the database interactions, and exploring the different functionalities of node and Mongoose.

The back end of this code is kept private for security concerns, but the following link will take you to the website where you can view and test all the different functionalities. A quick note, the database takes a second to load after being inactive for a period of time, but it will eventually wake up and the results will display.
